Please read the .pdf file Midpoint Circle Algorithm Documentation first! It will go into explanation and explain where these seemingly random checks and equations come from. I felt it was better to type something up in Word than try to explain it all in comments. Would recommend running the program in Visual Studio Community 2019 as that's what I programmed it in. I'll also include a video of the program running.
